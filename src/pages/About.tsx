        I am Software Engineer proficient in TypeScript and well-versed in
        popular frameworks such as React JS, Next JS, Vue JS, and Nuxt Js. Not
        just coding. I am passionate about creating clean and efficient code,
        automating testing code, and implementing modern design principles to
        deliver intuitive user experiences. With my technical expertise, I am
        able to create highly performant and elegant solutions that are easy to
        maintain and scale. I am always eager to learn new technologies and
        improve my skills
